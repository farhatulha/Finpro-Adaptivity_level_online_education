# Students Adaptability Level in Online Education
This is the final project from the data science bootcamp I attended. In this final project, I analyzed information on how students adapted to online learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. I got the dataset from Kaggle and analyzed it independently. Mentors and fellow participants reviewed the results of the project.

- **About Data** <br>
  Online Education has become a buzzword since the COVID-19 hit the World. Most of the educational institutions went online to continue educational activities while developing countries like Bangladesh took a significant period of time to ensure online education at every education level. <br>

  Students of several levels also faced many difficulties when they got introduced to online education. It is important for the decision makers of educational institutions to be informed about the effectiveness of online education so that they can take further steps to make it more beneficial for the students. <br>
- **Columns** <br>
  - Gender: Gender type
  - Age: Age range of student
  - Education Level: Education institution level
  - Institution Type:  Education institution type
  - IT Student: Studying as IT student or not
  - Location: Is the domicile of the students in Bangladesh.
  - Load-shedding: Level of load-shedding (power outage)
  - Financial Condition: Financial condition of family
  - Internet Type: Internet type used mostly in device
  - Network Type: Network connectivity type
  - Class Duration: Daily class duration
  - Self Lms: Institutionâ€™s own LMS availability
  - Device: Device mostly used in class
  - Adaptivity Level: Adaptability level of the student

  **Target:** Adaptivity Level

## EXPECTED OUTPUT
**Objective:**
Understand and analyze the factors that affect students' adaptation to the efficacy of online learning methods.
- Is gender, network type, and education level highly significant?
- What are the biggest barriers to adapting to online learning?
- Which factors are interconnected and impact student adaptation?

## âš™ PROCESS âš™
1. Import Libraries
2. Data Preparation
3. Data Processing
   - Null check
   - Duplicate check
4. Data Manipulation
   - Change data type: Object to Numeric (1 0)
   - Change data type: Object to Categorical
   - Change data type: Categorical to Ordinal Numeric
5. EDA
   - Data Understanding
   - Hipotesis : Uji Chi Square
   - Uji Kendall's Tau

## **ðŸ“Š Dataset Description ðŸ“Š**
ðŸ”´ Based on the data used, the dataset consists of ```14 columns```, ```1205 rows```, Data type ```object```, there is ```no null/Nan``` on the data, I found ```949 duplicate``` data and the target value of this data is Adaptivity Level. For the duplicate data found, I took no action because the dataset is categorical, so it's highly likely to have duplicate data. <br>

ðŸ”´ **Data Manipulation** Because all dataset types are objects, I started by converting to categorical type. Then change some to boolean and ordinal numeric datatype. However, for EDA, I kept the original categorical dataset.
- Boolean numeric:
  - ```IT Student```
  - ```Self Lms```
- Ordinal numeric:
  - ```Load Sheding```: Low = 1, High = 2
  - ```Financial Condition```: Poor = 1, Mid = 2, Rich = 3
  - ```Network Type```: 2G = 1, 3G = 2, 4G = 3
  - ```Adaptivity```: Low = 1, Moderate = 2, High = 3
  - ```Age```: 
  - ```Class Duration```:
