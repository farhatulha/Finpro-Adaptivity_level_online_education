# Students Adaptability Level in Online Education
This is the final project from the data science bootcamp I attended. In this final project, I analyzed information on how students adapted to online learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. I got the dataset from Kaggle and analyzed it independently. Mentors and fellow participants reviewed the results of the project.

- **About Data** <br>
  Online Education has become a buzzword since the COVID-19 hit the World. Most of the educational institutions went online to continue educational activities while developing countries like Bangladesh took a significant period of time to ensure online education at every education level. <br>

  Students of several levels also faced many difficulties when they got introduced to online education. It is important for the decision makers of educational institutions to be informed about the effectiveness of online education so that they can take further steps to make it more beneficial for the students. <br>

## **üìä Dataset Description üìä**
üî¥ Based on the data used, the dataset consists of ```14 columns```, ```1205 rows```, Data type ```object```, there is ```no null/Nan``` on the data, I found ```949 duplicate``` data and the target value of this data is Adaptivity Level. For the duplicate data found, I took no action because the dataset is categorical, so it's highly likely to have duplicate data. <br>

üî¥ Because all dataset types are objects, I started by converting to categorical type. Then change some to boolean and ordinal numeric datatype. However, for EDA, I kept and used the original categorical dataset.
- Boolean numeric:
  - ```IT Student```
  - ```Self Lms```
- Ordinal numeric:
  - ```Load Sheding```: Low = 1; High = 2
  - ```Financial Condition```: Poor = 1; Mid = 2; Rich = 3
  - ```Network Type```: 2G = 1; 3G = 2; 4G = 3
  - ```Adaptivity```: Low = 1; Moderate = 2; High = 3
  - ```Age```: 26-30 = 6; 21-25 = 5; 16-20 = 4; 11-15 = 3; 6-10 = 2; 1-5 = 1
  - ```Class Duration```: 3-6 = 2; 1-3 = 1; 0 = 0

## **üìä Understand the Data üìä**
**Adaptivity Level**
- Only 8.3% of students can adapt well to online learning methods.
- Almost 40% face difficulties in adapting to online learning methods.
- The most common adaptation level is at the Moderate level
  
**üëßüèªGenderüë¶üèª**
- More than half of the data population are males.
- When observed by 'Gender', males show better adaptation ability compared to females.
- The high adaptivity level for males is 10.7%, while for females it is only 5.4%.

**üéìAge, Education and IT Studentüìö**
- Students under the age of 15 account for a total of 40.2%.
- Students aged between 16-20 years old make up 23.1%
- At first, I thought there were no students from 'School' (Elementary, Junior, and Senior High) learning IT directly, but it turns out there are, although not as many as in universities.
- For now, we can ignore this education level because almost the majority of the data population are school children (43%) who are not learning IT.

**üìçLocationüîç**
- The dominant population is in Bangladesh with a high adaptivity rate of 9.8%.
- The population outside Bangladesh with high adaptivity is 3%.

**üí∏Financial Conditionüí∞**
- The dominant population for this financial condition is the middle class, with the most common adaptivity level being moderate, followed by low adaptivity, and the smallest being high adaptivity.

**üõúNetwork Levelü§≥üèª**
- The 'High' Adaptivity level for Network 4G is much higher compared to 3G and 2G.
- The dominant Adaptivity level for Network 4G is 'Moderate'.
- Location factor also appears to be associated with the network.
- It is evident from the graph that students living in Bangalore have better 4G and 3G internet networks compared to those outside Bangalore.

**‚ùìDEEP DIVE QUESTION‚ùî**
1. How does gender affect adaptability level?
2. Is Network Type the most important element influencing Adaptivity Level, among others variabel?
3. Does a better network type imply a higher level of adaptivity?
4. What is the relationship between IT student and adaptability level?
  
## ‚úÖ‚ùå HIPOTESIS
**Chi-Square Test**<br>
Based on the observed data, I'd like to find out the association between Adaptivity Level and the following features:
1. Gender
2. IT Student
3. Network Level.
  
    - H0: There is no significant association between the two categories.
    - H1: There is a significant association.

I used the chi-square test with a p-value of 0.05.

**Result** <br>
I rejected the null hypothesis (H0) since the p-values for all three variables are less than 0.05. The chi-square test findings show that the three factors are significantly related to the ```Adaptivity Level```.
- p-value for ```Network Type``` : 4.367322677925763e-06
- p-value for ```Gender``` : 0.0011997056689743298
- p-value for ```IT Student``` : 5.553333138404098e-05

Follow up questions:<br>
1. How about the other variables? Do they all have associations?
2. Which variable affects the Adaptivity Level the most significantly?

**End Result for chi-square test**
Based on the comprehensive analysis, it has been determined that every variable is connected to the Adaptivity Level. Among the variables, the Financial Condition p-value is the most significant, since it approaches 0 in comparison to the other ones. For Financial Condition, the p-value is 4.391228197442381e-50.

**Kendall's Tau**
After using the Chi-Square Test to investigate the association between two category variables in the original dataset, I'd like to assess the correlation or relationship of ranks between two ordinal variables from the altered dataset, now known as the 'adapt' dataset. This is a way of confirming up the hypothesis testing results gathered from the Chi-Square analysis. <br><br>

**Result**<br>
|Column|Kendall's Tau|P-value|
|---|---|---|
|Age|-0.175803|3.974028e-12|
|IT Student|0.066713|1.692131e-02|
|Location|0.142381|3.442763e-07|
|Load-shedding|0.054982|4.901781e-02|
|Financial Condition|-0.215882|2.295047e-15|
|Network Type|0.035150|2.048798e-01|
|Class Duration|0.249493|2.323724e-20|
|Self Lms|0.047085 |9.184954e-02|
|Adaptivity Level|1.000000|1.098905e-298|

**Kendall's Tau results indicate that the following factors are correlated:** <br>

1. There is a negative association between ```Age``` and ```Financial Condition```: The students who are older and have a lower financial status tend to be less adaptable.
2. ```IT Student```, ```Class Duration```, and ```Location``` show a positive correlation: Students with longer class periods, those staying in Bangladesh, and IT students indicate higher levels of adaptability.

**Kendall's Tau - Check the asosiation between Financial Condition with rest variabel**<br>
Since Financial Condition shows to have the most significant association based on the chi-square test and displays a negative correlation when examined using Kendall's Tau, I'd like to investigate its correlation with other variables.<br>

And the results show that a number of variables have substantial correlations:
- Education Level
- Internet Type
- Network Type
- Self Lms<br>
The associations between these variables are weak, even though they indicate strong correlations, saying that there might be more factors at influence.

## üìùCONCLUSIONS & RECOMMENDATIONSüì•
**DEEP DIVE ANSWERS**<br>
1. ```Gender``` has a significant correlation with ```Adaptivity Level```.
2. ```Financial Status``` is the variable that has the strongest correlation, not Network Type.
3. The graph indicates that there is virtually no upward trend between ```Adaptivity Level``` and the average ```Network Type```. Because the p-value is more than 0.05, the relationship between Network Type and Adaptivity Level is not statistically significant.
4. There is a strong positive relationship between ```Adaptivity Level``` and ```IT Student```. IT students tend to have higher levels of adaptability compared to non-IT students.

**üìåRECOMMENDATIONS**
1. **Financial Assistance**: Students who experience difficulty financially may be able to receive scholarships or subsidies from the government, which will make it easier for them to use online tools and services.
2. **Internet Access and devices**: Provide students from low-income households with easier and more affordable access to the internet and technical devices; additionally, extend internet coverage to places outside of Bangladeshi cities.
3. **Teacher and Parent Training**: Educate teachers and parents on how to assist their kids in their online education.
