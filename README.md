# Students Adaptability Level in Online Education
This is the final project from the data science bootcamp I attended. In this final project, I analyzed information on how students adapted to online learning as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. I got the dataset from Kaggle and analyzed it independently. Mentors and fellow participants reviewed the results of the project.

- **About Data** <br>
  Online Education has become a buzzword since the COVID-19 hit the World. Most of the educational institutions went online to continue educational activities while developing countries like Bangladesh took a significant period of time to ensure online education at every education level. <br>

  Students of several levels also faced many difficulties when they got introduced to online education. It is important for the decision makers of educational institutions to be informed about the effectiveness of online education so that they can take further steps to make it more beneficial for the students. <br>
